## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Where do I start. This project is massive, I have learnt alot while trying to complete this project and you can see
this with the amount of resources I used. The project thought me about responsive images, 
SASS, 
using partials in SASS,
SVGs, 
the advantages of having SVGs in your html rather than using a SVG in an image tag,
managing css of large scale projects,
naming classes,
CSS grid,




### Continued development
For continued development:
responsive images,
absolute and relative positioning,
stacking context,
pseudo elements, and
svgs.
